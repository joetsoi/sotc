An extractor that converts SotC nmo files to ogreXML, also a general playground for me
trying out various boost libaries and a bit of ogre. maybe explore c++ templates and metaprogramming

General Guide
-------------
1. Go buy yourself a copy of Shadow Of The Colossus and a Ps2
2. Play the fuck out of it for the next couple of months
3. Now go get ICO and play the fuck out of that, at least twice so you get the nice extras
4. Wait fervently for the HD remake and The Last Guardian
5. Play the fuck out of those.
1000. come back and see if I have done anything interesting.

Once you've done that.

Compiling
_____________
you'll need cmake, ogre, boost and freeimage

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make

for an out of source build
